Welcome to the Waking Up podcast. This is Sam Harris. T
oday I’ll be speaking with a man whose work I greatly admire—Dan Carlin, the host of the
 
Hardcore History
 
and Common Sense podcasts—
and Dan and I will be releasing this conversation jointly on both of our podcasts. We’re calling this a “crosscast,” which is analogous to a crosspost one sometimes sees on blogs that publish content simultaneously. It turns out we have many listeners in common, and many of you have been urging us to have a conversation, I think anticipating considerable disagreement on issues like the War on Terror, state security, and foreign policy. I don’t know that we collided as much as anyone might have expected, but we’ve had a good, energetic conversation, which I greatly enjoyed and I hope you will too. So in a moment, I give you Dan Carlin…
SH: Hey, Dan, how are you doing?
DC: I’m good, how are you?
SH: I’m great. Well, listen, as my listeners know, I have been frequently referring to you as the greatest history professor on earth, and I know this may cause you to blush, but I am just a huge fan of your Hardcore History podcast and have been recommending it to anyone with ears at this point.
DC: That is very dirty pool to start off a discussion with a compliment like that, because now what am I supposed to say? You said some of the nicest things, and I really appreciate them, thank you so much. Listen, isn’t it amazing we’re having these kinds of public discussions in the virtual realm here where everyone gets to watch? Modern technology has taken us back almost to an Athens-type situation, where we can have these sorts of public conversations and we don’t require some TV network to figure out if they can sell airtime or whatever for something like that. It’s a pretty interesting new world.
SH: Yeah, and I do not say this to preempt any criticism—
DC: Which always comes from me. That’s what I’m going to do.
SH: Actually, this was a question I wanted to ask you. You refer to yourself as “a fan of history,” and you are at pains to distinguish yourself from a professional historian or the legions thereof who may, in fact, be listening to your show and scrutinizing it for errors. Do you get pushback from academics? What’s that experience like for you?
DC: Well, I have to be honest. My own opinion here, but I think everyone’s been remarkably generous and nice to me on everything, because I had envisioned a completely different type of program when we started it. I wasn’t going to talk about any sort of narrative history at all. I was just going to talk about “Isn’t this weird?” and “Isn’t this funny?” and stuff history majors used to talk about on their lunch break. As the show evolved, the audience wanted more of the background, and so it went into territory I had never given a lot of thought to. You know, “Do I want to go challenge historians?” or something like that. This is why we use so many quotes and whatnot during the program, because I think, coming from the position that you know you’re not an expert, you’re not pretending to be an expert, when you make some sort of statement, we feel like you want “audio footnotes.” You want to say, “Listen, it’s not me saying this—here’s a couple of historical points of view.” You’re still picking and choosing, so it’s not totally fair, but I think I build that into the way we do things. If I was a professional historian with all the credentials and published all this, I would approach the program differently. Because I’m not, I try to make sure that every time we say something, we have somebody who is credible and trustworthy—or at least someone we should listen to a little bit more than the podcast host—back up what I’m saying. It’s become a key way that the show has evolved.
SH: Well, I wonder how deep that caveat actually cuts, because in my career, I have weighed in on many questions that fall outside the official area of my academic expertise, and occasionally I get pushback on this very point, that I don’t have a credential that would cause someone to be confident about my opinions in this area—let’s say on the topic of religion. But many of these subjects simply require that one read the books and be attentive to one’s sources and have conversations with experts. And at a certain point you’re playing the same language game the experts are. It’s certainly appropriate to have humility and be attentive to the frontiers of one’s ignorance, but in science this really breaks down quite starkly, because I’m surrounded by scientists who simply do not have the academic bona fides you would expect, and yet they are contributing in various areas of science at the highest level. There are physicists who don’t have Ph.D.s in physics; there are computer scientists who don’t have even college degrees. I am in dialogue now with an expert on artificial intelligence who never went to high school, so at a certain point it’s a matter of how you can function in a given domain, not a matter of what your CV looks like. And scientists, as long as you’re making sense, accept this far more readily, in my experience, than people in the humanities. I’m wondering how you view this, because unless you’re making mistakes and not correcting them, I don’t see how you’re not functioning as an expert on those topics you touch. Maybe if you want to be an expert on World War II, or at least the Nazi side of it, you need to deal with primary sources in German, and that’s some wrinkle there. But I’m just wondering how you see that.
DC: I think it sort of depends on the specialty we’re talking about. For example, take a surgeon who operates on people’s brains. I think we can agree that you’re not going to want your amateur brain surgeon coming in and saying, “Listen, I read this expert, and this is how he suggests we do it.” There’s a specific specialty there. I think bringing up the humanities, though, is a wonderful point, because the humanities by their very nature are all things with much more leeway than you get in something like brain surgery, for example. Look at the subjects that make up the humanities: law, religion, language, arts, music. I think the way to put it would be that you were just suggesting that people outside the expertise have something, perhaps, that they can bring to the table. In a lot of these cases, I think it three-dimensionalizes things a little bit to have somebody from another discipline apply the mode of thinking common in their discipline to an unusual realm—in other words, get a 360° view of things.Take a historical event. You might want to have the Second World War examined by somebody who’s an expert in military affairs. Obviously, somebody who’s an expert in international relations is going to write a book with a different point of view. One of the best books I ever read on the Second World War was done by an economist who looked at it from a completely different point of view. So in that sense, I think you can three-dimensionalize reality, and that’s what you’re doing when you look at history—you’re looking at a moment in reality, and there are multiple Rashomons, a variety of ways to look at things. What I maybe bring to the table is, I’m looking at this from outside the specialty. You know, when you deal with a lot of historians today, you are dealing with scientists in a certain realm. These are people who aren’t going to talk about things that they can’t quantify. Any good scientist is going to want to be able to back up what they say in a peer-reviewed journal. That’s how a lot of historians are today. But the specialty they study takes away that ability to look at things from a farther-away lens. So fifty years ago you would’ve had all these historians who would’ve been just fine looking at events as though they were in a satellite and giving you these big pronouncements. Most historians today wouldn’t be comfortable with that. The problem is, historians aren’t dealing with brain surgery, they’re dealing with human beings. That by its very nature is hard to quantify and hard to get your mind around. So I guess it gives me a lot more leeway than a brain surgeon. And they’ve been very kind to me, all these professionals. I think they sometimes don’t like the way I dramatize events, but I look at this like what Alfred Hitchcock famously said about drama: Drama is just reality with the boring bits taken out. That’s kind of how I look at the history show. I’m giving you the story that an author would give you or a writer would give you or a historian fifty years ago might give you.
SH: Well, what you’re doing is fantastic, and that will be my last dollop of praise before we get into areas of controversy."

In the streets, our heads are liftin'
As we lose our inhibition
Celebration, it surrounds us
Every nation, all around us
[Pre-Chorus]
Staying forever young
Singin' songs underneath the sun
Let's rejoice in the beautiful game
And together at the end of the day
We all say
[Chorus]
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
So wave your flag, now wave your flag
Now wave your flag (Oh-oh, oh)"

Before you judge me, take a look at yourself

It ain't due that you hate that I hate what you do

Despite all the piety you've been consuming thus far
A backstabbing motherfucker to the core is what you are

My eyes are catching fire and my heart starts to burn
A foot away from you is like a bit closer to heaven
Then again it's like being needled 24/7

[Verse 1]
On a cold winter morning
In the time before the light
In flames of Death's eternal reign
We ride towards the fight
When the darkness has fallen down
And the times are tough, alright
The sound of evil laughter falls
Around the world tonight
Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel
Through the wastelands evermore
The scattered souls will feel the hell
Bodies wasted on the shores
[Pre-Chorus]
On the blackest plains, in hell's domain
We watch them as they go
In fire and pain, now once again
We know
[Chorus]
So now, we fly ever free, we're free before the thunderstorm
On towards the wilderness, our quest carries on
Far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls
So far away, we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames, we carry on"

I might give her another ring as I'm dialing out her number
But it really doesn't matter, as long as we love each other
You know?
[Chorus - Megurine Crystal Luka + (Fred E. Fox)]
Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover, I'd never lie (I love you, mi amor)
He said ""be true, "" I swear I'll try
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love, the crazy kind
I am his, and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I"

Jason Derulo, ah
Savage love (
685, baby
)
[Verse 1: Jason Derulo]
If I woke up without ya, I don't know what I would do
Thought I could be single forever 'til I met you
Usually, don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' fast
You got a way of keepin' me comin' back-to-back
I just found out, the only reason that you lovin' me
Was to get back at your ex-lover, but before you leave
Usually, I would never, would never even care
But, baby, I know you're creepin', I feel it in the air
[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Every night and every day
I try to make you stay
But your
[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel, but your savage love
When you kiss me, I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that"

Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)
[Pre-Chorus]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)
[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)
[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no ""Mrs.""
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, ""Which one?"" I say, ""Nah, I want all of 'em""
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms"

Walkin' down 29th and Park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said somethin' to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do
[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're movin' on with someone new
[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then, I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah

Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursin' an empty bottle and tellin' myself
You're happier, aren't you?

 With summer now  upon us I decided to compile a playlist (if you will) of a majority of songs that I feel set a hype or positive vibe and that can be expressed almost anywhere. Obviously songs labeled explicit may have some swearing (some may have a lot) but overall get things bumpin'
Music here spans a variety of genres that come from many artists I personally admire. Hope you give some of these a listen to and have a great time wherever you may play them!

[Strophe]
Ey, wo ist mein Yoghurt hin?
Darauf freu' ich mich schon seit 'ner Ewigkeit
Kein Yoghurt weit und breit
Das er da war, weiß ich mit Sicherheit
Das macht keinen Sinn
Gibt keine Zeugen und keiner weiß Bescheid
Ich hoffe, es tut euch leid
Ich, ich hoffe es, tut euch leid (mhmhm)
[Pre-Refrain]
Wer von euch klaute mein Dessert?
Ich hoff' wirklich, das war's euch wert
Irgendwer hat ihn ausgeleert
Ich will nur meinen Yoghurt
Wie erträgt man nur diesen Schmerz
Denkt doch mal, wie das für euch wär'
Entschuldigungen ändern jetzt auch nichts mehr
Das war mein letzter Yoghurt
[Refrain]
Oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
Das war dein letzter Yoghurt
Oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i

Je pensais que ça ne finirait jamais
Oh mon amant, oh mon autre, oh mon ami
Nous avons parlé en rond et
Nous avons parlé et puis
Je t'ai aimé jusqu'à la lune et aussi pendant le retour
Tu as donné, à tout, cette lueur dorée
Maintenant éteint toutes les étoiles, parce que je le sais
Que ça fait mal comme ça
Laisser partir quelqu'un

Toutes les tempêtes que nous avons surmontées
Tout ce que nous avons traversé
Maintenant, sans toi, que diable dois-je faire ?
Quand j'ai appelé les mathématiciens et
Je leur ai demandé d'expliquer
Ils ont dit que l'amour n'est égal qu'à la douleur
Et quand tout allait mal
Tu pourrais transformer mon chagrin en chanson
Oh, ça fait mal comme ça

Nok en number one smash ifra Kholebeatz og Big Oral Bee

Sola skinner hissig, alt er juicy sånn som Jamba
Drikker på noen drinker mens noen bitches danser samba
Whisky drink, vodka drink, sånn som Chumbawamba
Beezy er en ambassadør for den G-shiten
Du er mer en ambassadør for den glee-shiten
Men hvis du putter på no' Snoop, så digger vi shiten
Beezyboy er fortsatt på den Spiller Nummer 10-shiten
Ahh, denne dagen er så clean
Skal BBQ-e heavy som min homie Sven Nordin
Bare ta med deg noen hoes hvis du er keen
Har paller med no' Henny, vi har kjelleren full av vin
Så fyr den grillen opp for alle mine riders
Vil du ha chicken, eller går du for noen sliders? (jeg går for sliders, man!)
Hey homie, hvordan vil du ha det?
Finn deg en bitch, la bootyen bade i no' marinade
Min barbeque-brigade, vi kjører full fres
Har du glemt å ta med spare ribs er det null pes
Få en lady til å løpe ned på Rema
Oss ballers ha'kke tid til sånn, for vi må følge skjema
Kvelden har et tema - å keepe shiten playa
Jeg chatta med en superdeilig chick som het Andrea
Vi typa, skypa, i kveld, så blir hun pipa
Hun kommer om en halvtime, så Beezyboy er hypa"

What's up everyone! Let's take a look at what's been going on in UK music!
News
Firstly, let's welcome 
@CaptainCait
 to the UK community! Great job on becoming an editor!
Now, some interesting news: even though Ed Sheeran didn't release any music in 2018, 
he's still the UK's most-played artist of that year.
 Ed's been in the top for the past three years. Meanwhile, listeners in the UK 
loved
 UK music in 2018, with only one foreign artist having a place in the charts.
Some more charts for you, this time the radio airplay charts! Ed Sheeran was top of these as well, but he didn't have the most-played song; this spot was held by Portugal the Man's ""Feel it Still"".  Jess Glynne's ""These Days"" came in second; she's appeared in the top ten radio airplay charts four times in the last five years!
Meanwhile, the music artists for New Horizons 2019 have been unveiled. These twelve artists, including Eve Goodman, HANNA2K and Endaf, will get the chance to play gigs and festivals to boost their profiles!

Remember who was there when I fell behind
To give me confidence when I'm self declined
Bitches on the gram wanna sell me time
I keep coppin' out and I don't know why
Maybe I get bored of the whole thing
Check the melody, I'm making my soul sing

Bu yüzden abanoz ağacından kesilmiş, yirmi bin dolarlık bir masa koydum

Hep paran hakkında konuşuyorsun, işitme cihazına ihtiyacın var
Benim hakkımda konuşuyorsun, üzerimde gölge göremiyorum

There's a thousand reasons I should go about my day
And ignore your whispers, which I wish would go away, oh-oh-oh

And if I heard you, which I don't, I'm spoken for, I fear

I'm afraid of what I'm risking if I follow you

Nine in the Afternoon - Single Mix,Panic!

A man is cooking large slabs of meat on a gas grill as two dozen people mingle with glasses of bourbon and bottles of beer in the cool, damp breeze blowing in off the ocean. All of these people are would-be movers and shakers in American higher education—the 
historic, world-leading system that constitutes one of this country’s greatest economic assets
—but 
not one of them is an academic.
 They’re all tech 
entrepreneurs
. Or, as the local vernacular has it, 
hackers
.
Some of them are the kinds of hackers a college dean could love: folks who have come up with ingenious but polite ways to make campus life work better. Standing over there by the case of Jim Beam, for instance, are the founders of OneSchool, a mobile app that helps students navigate college by offering campus maps, course schedules, phone directories, and the like in one interface. The founders are all computer science majors who dropped out of Penn State last semester. I ask the skinniest and geekiest among them how he joined the company. He was first recruited last spring, he says, when his National Merit Scholarship profile mentioned that he likes to design iPhone apps in his spare time. He’s nineteen years old.
But many of the people here are engaged in business pursuits far more revolutionary in their intentions. That preppy-looking guy near the barbecue? He’s launching a company called Degreed, which aims to upend the traditional monopoly that colleges and universities hold over the minting of professional credentials; he wants to use publicly available data 
like academic rank and grade inflation to standardize the comparative value of different college degrees
, then allow people to add information about what they’ve learned outside of college to their baseline degree “score.” It’s the kind of idea that could end up fizzling out before anyone’s really heard of it, or could, just maybe, have huge consequences for the market in credentials. And that woman standing by the tree? She’s the recent graduate of Columbia University who works for a company called Kno, which is aiming to upset the $8 billion textbook industry with cheaper, better, 
electronic
 textbooks delivered through tablet computers. And then there’s the guy standing to her right wearing a black fleece zip-up jacket: five days ago, he announced the creation of the Minerva Project, the 
“first new elite American university in over a century.”
Last August, 
Marc Andreessen
, the man whose Netscape Web browser ignited the original dot-com boom and who is now one of Silicon Valley’s most influential venture capitalists, wrote a much-discussed op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. His argument was that “software is eating the world.” At a time of low start-up costs and broadly distributed Internet access that allows for massive economies of scale, software has reached a tipping point that will allow it to disrupt industry after industry, in a dynamic epitomized by the recent collapse of Borders under the giant foot of Amazon. And the next industries up for wholesale transformation by software, Andreessen wrote, are health care and education. That, at least, is where he’s aiming his venture money. And where Andreessen goes, others follow. According to the National Venture Capital Association, investment in education technology companies increased from less than $100 million in 2007 to nearly $400 million last year. For the huge generator of innovation, technology, and wealth that is Silicon Valley, higher education is a particularly fat target right now.
This hype has happened before, of course. Back in the 1990s, when Andreessen made his first millions, many people confidently predicted that the Internet would render brick-and-mortar universities obsolete. It hasn’t happened yet, in part because 
colleges are a lot more complicated than retail bookstores
. Higher education is a publicly subsidized, heavily regulated, culturally entrenched sector that has 
stubbornly
 resisted 
digital rationalization
. But the defenders of the ivy-covered walls have never been more nervous about the Internet threat. In June, a panicked board of directors at the University of Virginia fired (and, after widespread outcry, rehired) their president, in part because they worried she was too slow to move Thomas Jefferson’s university into the digital world.
The ongoing carnage in the newspaper industry provides an object lesson of what can happen when a long-established, 
information-focused industry’s business model is challenged by low-price competitors online
. The disruptive power of information technology may be our best hope for curing the 
chronic college cost disease
 that is driving a growing number of students into ruinous debt or out of higher education altogether. It may also be an existential threat to institutions that have long played a crucial role in American life.
I’m here at this party and in the Bay Area for the next few days to observe the habits, folkways, and codes of the barbarians at the gate—to see how close they’ve come toward finding business models and technologies that could wreak such havoc on higher education. My guide, and my host at this party—he organized the event for my benefit—is a man named Michael Staton. With sandy-blond hair, blue eyes, and a sunburned complexion, Michael is thirty-one—old by start-up standards—and recently married. He’s the president and “chief evangelist” of Inigral, a company he created five years ago to build college-branded social networks for incoming undergraduates. But just as importantly for my purposes, he’s also one of those people who has a knack for connecting with others, a high-link node in a growing network of education technology entrepreneurs who have set their sights on the mammoth higher education industry.
One of the bedrooms in the house where we’re mingling and drinking was Inigral’s headquarters for the first eight months of its existence, back when the founders were “bootstrapping” the company, which is valleyspeak for growing the business on their own using credit cards, waitering tips, plasma donation proceeds, and other sources that don’t involve the investment dollars that can shoot a start-up toward fame and fortune at the price of diluting the founder’s ownership and control. The longer someone can manage to feed themselves with ramen noodles and keep things going via bootstrapping, the more of their company they’ll ultimately get to keep—unless someone else comes up with the same idea, takes the venture capital (VC) money earlier, and uses it to blow them to smithereens. The start-up culture is full of such tough decisions about money, timing, and power, which are, in their own way, just as complicated and risky as the task of building new businesses that will delight the world and disrupt a trillion-dollar market.
After the guests leave, Michael and I retire to the living room with one of his colleagues, Nick. The conversation comes around to how the money works. Nick explains that, nowadays, there is a basic philosophical divide among venture capitalists. One way of thinking goes like this: technology is a winner-takes-all world. For every Facebook, there are dozens of Friendsters lying in a pile of dead companies with silly made-up names. The difference between winning and losing everything often comes down to timing and execution. Everyone knew social networks would be huge. Mark Zuckerberg just did it better, so he won. Talent, meanwhile, is always scarce. So the VC guys try to identify the smartest people with the best teams in their quest to back the 
winner who takes all
.
The second way of thinking—the one that Nick finds more plausible—is that the world is too complicated and chaotic to accurately predict which company will have the exact combination of talent, luck, and timing to be victorious. There’s no way to know who will come out of the scrum with the ball. Therefore, the smart strategy is to invest in the entire scrum—to bet on categories, not people. The recent surge of money into higher education startups reflects growing interest in the category. My goal is to find out what it’s like in the middle of the scrum.
It’s 10:30 a.m. on my first full day in the valley. I’m in San Mateo, twenty miles south of San Francisco, at the offices of Learn Capital, an education-focused venture capital firm. Having driven down from the city in Michael’s Honda CRV, he and I take the elevator to the second floor, where one of the firm’s partners, Nathaniel Whittemore, brings us into a glass-walled conference room. We walk by five people sitting around a table, some with headphones on, each staring intently at a thirteen inch MacBook Air. “Do they work for you?” I ask, nodding at the people outside the glass, assuming they’re junior investment analysts or somesuch.
“No,” he says. “They’re one of our investments. That’s OpenStudy.” By which he means: the entirety of the company known as OpenStudy—its personnel and infrastructure—was sitting around that table. Open- Study is a Web site that allows people to create online study groups, for free. “Tired of studying alone?” their site asks. “Connect with learners studying the same things you are.” OpenStudy says it has 100,000 students from 170 countries and 1,600 schools. Because all of the computing capacity, electronic memory, secure backup, and related telecommunication infrastructure necessary to do this can be bought as cheap commodities from a remote provider, the actual physical infrastructure needed to run an ed tech start-up like OpenStudy consists of, in its entirety, five lovely aluminum computers (
nearly everyone I meet in Silicon Valley has a thirteen-inch Air
), five ergonomically designed black chairs (they are always black), one table, and a wi-fi connection. I ask Nathaniel about how Learn Capital sees the world. 
Is the real money to be made, per Marc Andreessen, in eating the existing education industry? Or will it be in providing service to the industry, helping them do what they do better?
 In 
terms popularized by Harvard business professor Clayton Christensen
, this is the difference between “disruptive” and “sustaining” innovation.
Nathaniel says that’s an “ideological” question. Learn Capital looks for two things, he says: “highly relevant niche plays,” which sound like a sustaining innovation, and winner-takes-all “platforms,” which sound like university eaters to me. In fact, if one word defines the dialogue of my trip to the valley, it is “platform.” Investors want to put their money in platforms, and start-ups want to build platforms, because right now, and for the foreseeable future, platforms rule the world."

Things are shaping up to be pretty odd
Little deaths in musical beds
So it seems I'm someone I've never met
You will only hear these elegant crimes
Fall on your ears from criminal dimes
They spill unfound from a pretty mouth
[Pre-Chorus]
And everybody gets there, everybody gets their
And everybody gets their way
I never said I missed her when everybody kissed her
Now I’m the only one to blame
[Chorus]
Things have changed for me, and that's okay
I feel the same, I'm on my way and I say
Things have changed for me, and that's okay

I want to go where everyone goes
I want to know what everyone knows
I want to go where everyone feels the same

I never said I'd leave this town
A falling out we won't tiptoe about"

Nightmares and violent shapes
The state of dreaming has left me numb
Blue eyes and wandering lips
True lies through fingertips
Hidden tales of forbidden love

Miserable, miserable, miserable

Teardrops of acid rain
Burning down through my veins
Can't I just sleep for a night?

Even while others knew
Oh, when can one wake and live again?

\nHe was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
\nMost people looked at him with terror and with fear
\nBut to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear

Goode\n\n\n\nHe use to carry his guitar in a gunny sack\n\nAnd sit beneath the trees by the railroad track.\n\nOh, the engineers used to see him sitting in the shade,\n\nStrumming to the rhythm that the drivers made.\n\nPeople passing by would stop and say\n\nOh my that little country boy could play\n\n\n\nGo Go\n\nGo Johnny Go\n\nGo Go\n\nJohnny B.

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

 With summer now  upon us I decided to compile a playlist (if you will) of a majority of songs that I feel set a hype or positive vibe and that can be expressed almost anywhere. Obviously songs labeled explicit may have some swearing (some may have a lot) but overall get things bumpin'
Music here spans a variety of genres that come from many artists I personally admire. Hope you give some of these a listen to and have a great time wherever you may play them!

(feat. MØ)
Do you recall, not long ago
Θυμασαι πριν λιγο καιρο
We would walk on the sidewalk
Εμεις θελαμε να διασχισουμε το πεζοδρομιο
Innocent, remember?
Αθωα θυμασαι?
All we did was care for each other
Το μονο που μας ενοιαζε ηταν να φροντιζουμε ο ενας τον αλλον
But the night was warm
Αλλα  την νυχτα ηταν ζεστα
We were bold and young
Ειμασταν τολμηροι και νεοι
All around the wind blows
Ολα τα επαιρνε ο ανεμος
We would only hold on to let go
Εμεις δεν κρατουσαμε τιποτα μεσα μας ολα τα ξεχνουσαμε
[Chorus 2x:]
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
Φιλα με απασφαλισε ακινητοποιησε με
We need someone to lean on
Χρειαζομαστε καποιον να μας στηριζει
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
Φιλησε με ακινητοποιησε με
All we need is somebody to lean on
Ολοι χρειαζομαστε καποιον  για να στηριχθουμε"

Yet I do, yet I do

\nJust follow me, I'll get you there\n\nYou can try and read my lyric off of this paper before I lay 'em\n\nBut you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em\n\n'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem\n\nWhen I say I'ma do somethin', I do it, I don't give a damn\n\nWhat you think, I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world\n\nFeed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me\n\nI'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably\n\nAnd all those who look down on me\n\nI'm tearin' down your balcony\n\nNo ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or ""how can he""\n\nFrom Infinite down to the last Relapse album, he's\n\nStill shittin', whether he's on salary, paid hourly\n\nUntil he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him\n\nWhichever comes first, for better or worse\n\nHe's married to the game\n\nLike a ""fuck you"" for Christmas: his gift is a curse\n\nForget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt\n\nAnd fuck the whole Universe\n\n\n\nI'm not afraid to take a stand\n\nEverybody, come take my hand\n\nWe'll walk this road together, through the storm\n\nWhatever weather, cold or warm\n\nJust lettin' you know that you're not alone\n\nHolla if you feel like you've been down the same road\n\n\n\nOkay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap\n\nI shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm\n\nFor you to know it's a wrap\n\nYou said you was king, you lied through your teeth\n\nFor that, fuck your feelings\n\nInstead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped\n\nAnd to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back\n\nI promise to never go back on that promise\n\nIn fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ehhhh\n\nPerhaps I ran them accents into the ground\n\nRelax, I ain't goin' back to that now\n\nAll I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack BLAOW\n\nCause I ain't playin' around\n\nThere's a game called circle and I don't know how\n\nI'm way too up to back down\n\nBut I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out\n\nThought I had it mapped out\n\nBut I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud\n\nStill follows me around, but it's time to exorcise these demons\n\nThese muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now\n\n\n\nI'm not afraid to take a stand\n\nEverybody, come take my hand\n\nWe'll walk this road together, through the storm\n\nWhatever weather, cold or warm\n\nJust lettin' you know that you're not alone\n\nHolla if you feel like you've been down the same road\n\n\n\nAnd I just can't keep livin' this way\n\nSo startin' today, I'm breakin' out of this cage\n\nI'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons\n\nI'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground\n\nI've had enough, now I'm so fed up\n\nTime to put my life back together right now\n\n\n\nIt was my decision to get clean, I did it for me\n\nAdmittedly I probably did it subliminally for you\n\nSo I could come back a brand-new me\n\nYou helped see me through\n\nAnd don't even realize what you did, believe me you\n\nI've been through the wringer\n\nBut they can do little to the middle finger\n\nI think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of\n\nMy world, haters can make like bees with no stingers\n\nAnd drop dead: no more beef flingers\n\nNo more drama from now on, I promise\n\nTo focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father\n\nSo I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters\n\nAnd raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it\n\nCause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club\n\nOr the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up\n\nCause I'm raisin' the bar\n\nI'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars\n\nI feel amazin', and I'm\n\n\n\nI'm not afraid to take a stand\n\nEverybody, come take my hand\n\nWe'll walk this road together, through the storm\n\nWhatever weather, cold or warm\n\nJust lettin' you know that you're not alone\n\nHolla if you feel like you've been down the same road"

\nTo seize everything you ever wanted-One moment
\nWould you capture it or just let it slip? \nHis palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy \nThere's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti\n\nHe's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready \n\nTo drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin \n\nWhat he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud \n\nHe opens his mouth, but the words won't come out\n\nHe's chokin, how everybody's jokin now\n\nThe clock's run out, time's up overblaw\n\nSnap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity\n\nOh, there goes Rabbit, he choked\n\nHe's so mad, but he won't give up that\n\nEasy, no\n\nHe won't have it , he knows his whole back's to these ropes\n\nIt don't matter, he's dope\n\nHe knows that, but he's broke\n\nHe's so stagnant that he knows \n\nWhen he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's\n\nBack to the lab again yo\n\nThis whole rap shit\n\nHe better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him\n\n\n\nYou better lose yourself in the music, the moment \n\nYou own it, you better never let it go \n\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow \n\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo \n\n\n\n\n\nYou better lose yourself in the music, the moment \n\nYou own it, you better never let it go \n\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow \n\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo \n\n\n\n\n\nThe soul's escaping, through this hole that it's gaping\n\nThis world is mine for the taking\n\nMake me king, as we move toward a, new world order \n\nA normal life is borin, but superstardom's close to post mortem\n\nIt only grows harder, only grows hotter \n\nHe blows us all over these hoes is all on him\n\nCoast to coast shows, he's know as the globetrotter\n\nLonely roads, God only knows\n\nHe's grown farther from home, he's no father\n\nHe goes home and barely knows his own daughter\n\nBut hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water \n\nHis hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product \n\nThey moved on to the next schmoe who flows\n\nHe nose dove and sold nada\n\nSo the soap opera is told and unfolds\n\nI suppose it's old partna', but the beat goes on\n\nDa da dum da dum da da\n\n\n\nYou better lose yourself in the music, the moment \n\nYou own it, you better never let it go \n\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow \n\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo \n\n\n\nYou better lose yourself in the music, the moment \n\nYou own it, you better never let it go \n\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow \n\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo \n\n\n\nNo more games, I'ma change what you call rage \n\nTear this mothafuckin roof off like 2 dogs caged \n\nI was playin in the beginnin, the mood all changed \n\nI been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage \n\nBut I kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cypher \n\nBest believe somebody's payin the pied piper\n\nAll the pain inside amplified by the fact \n\nThat I can't get by with my 9 to 5 \n\nAnd I can't provide the right type of life for my family \n\nCuz man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers \n\nAnd it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life \n\nAnd these times are so hard and it's getting even harder \n\nTryin to feed and water my seed, plus \n\nSee dishonor caught up between being a father and a prima donna \n\nBaby mama drama's screamin on and \n\nToo much for me to wanna \n\nStay in one spot, another day of monotony \n\nHas gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail \n\nI've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot \n\nSuccess is my only mothafuckin option, failure's not \n\nMom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go \n\nI cannot grow old in Salem's lot \n\nSo here I go is my shot.\n\nFeet fail me not cuz maybe the only opportunity that I got\n\n\n\nYou better lose yourself in the music, the moment \n\nYou own it, you better never let it go \n\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow \n\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo \n\n\n\nYou better lose yourself in the music, the moment \n\nYou own it, you better never let it go \n\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow \n\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo \n\n\n\nYou can do anything you set your mind to, man"

Gnosticism: an esoteric system of mystical religious and philosophical doctrines, stressing knowledge as essential to salvation, viewing matter as evil, and variously combining ideas derived from mythology, ancient Greek philosophy, ancient religions, and, eventually, Christianity.  In short, it is a system of “salvation by knowledge” rather than salvation through Jesus Christ.
2) The Signs of Society — Jesus said that society will become increasingly lawless and immoral as the time approaches for His return. In fact, He said it would become as evil as it was in the days of Noah
The Spiritual Signs The positive spiritual signs include the proclamation of the Gospel to the whole world (Matthew 24:14), a great outpouring of the Holy Spirit (Joel 2:28-32), and spiritual illumination to understand prophecies that have been ""sealed up"" until the end times (Daniel 12:4,9).
5) The Signs of World Politics — The Bible prophesies that there will be a certain pattern of world politics that will characterize the end time geopolitical map.

I close my eyes and I can see
A world that's waiting up for me
That I call my own
Through the dark, through the door
Through where no one's been before
But it feels like home
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say I've lost my mind
I don't care, I don't care, so call me crazy
We can live in a world that we design
'Cause every night I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keepin' me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
Oh, a million dreams for the world we're gonna make
There's a house we can build
Every room inside is filled
With things from far away
Special things I compile
Each one there to make you smile
On a rainy day"

Right here, right now, I put the offer out
I don't wanna chase you down but I know you see it
You run with me and I can cut you free
Out of the drudgery and walls you keep in
So trade that typical for somethin' colorful
And if it's crazy, live a little crazy
You can play it sensible, a king of conventional
Or you can risk it all and see
Don't you wanna get away
From the same old part you gotta play
'Cause I got what you need so come with me and take the ride
It'll take you to the other side
'Cause you can do like you do or you can do like me
Stay in the cage or you'll finally take the key
Oh, damn, suddenly you're free to fly
It'll take you to the other side
[PHILLIP CARLYLE]
Okay, my friend, you want to cut me in
Well, I hate to tell you but it just won't happen
So thanks, but no, I think I'm good to go
'Cause I quite enjoy the life you say I'm trapped in
Now I admire you and that whole show you do
You're onto somethin', really, it's somethin'
But I live among the swells and we don't pick up peanut shells
I'll have to leave that up to you"

City of stars
Are you shining just for me?

There's so much that I can't see
Who knows?
I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you
That now, our dreams
They've finally come true
[Verse 2: Mia]
City of stars
Just one thing everybody wants
There in the bars
And through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants
It's love
Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else

Both

A rush, 
a glance
A touch, 
a dance
A look in somebody's eyes
To light up the skies
To open the world and send it reeling
A voice that says, ""I'll be here""
And ""you'll be alright""
I don't care if I know
Just where I will go
'Cause all that I need is this crazy feeling
A rat-tat-tat on my heart
Think I want it to stay"

Would love this swirling sky
But there's only you and I
And we've got no shot
This could never be
You're not the type for me

\nI left him at a Greyhound station west of Santa Fé

\nStill I did what I had to do\n\n'Cause I just knew\n\n\n\nSummer: Sunday nights\n\nWe'd sink into our seats\n\nRight as they dimmed out all the lights\n\nA Technicolor world made out of music and machine\n\nIt called me to be on that screen\n\nAnd live inside each scene\n\n\n\nWithout a nickel to my name\n\nHopped a bus, here I came\n\nCould be brave or just insane\n\nWe'll have to see\n\n\n\n'Cause maybe in that sleepy town\n\nHe'll sit one day, the lights are down\n\nHe'll see my face and think of how he...\n\n...used to know me\n\n\n\nClimb these hills\n\nI'm reaching for the heights\n\nAnd chasing all the lights that shine\n\nAnd when they let you down\n\nYou'll get up off the ground\n\n'Cause morning rolls around\n\nAnd it's another day of sun\n\n\n\nI hear 'em ev'ry day\n\nThe rhythms in the canyons that'll never fade away\n\nThe ballads in the barrooms left by those who came before\n\nThey say ""you gotta want it more""\n\nSo I bang on ev'ry door\n\n\n\nAnd even when the answer's ""no""\n\nOr when my money's running low\n\nThe dusty mic and neon glow\n\nAre all I need\n\n\n\nAnd someday as I sing my song\n\nA small-town kid'll come along\n\nThat'll be the thing to push him on and go go\n\n\n\nClimb these hills\n\nI'm reaching for the heights\n\nAnd chasing all the lights that shine\n\nAnd when they let you down\n\nYou'll get up off the ground\n\n'Cause morning rolls around\n\nAnd it's another day of sun\n\n\n\nAnd when they let you down\n\nThe morning rolls around\n\n\n\nIt's another day of sun\n\nIt's another day of sun\n\nIt's another day of sun\n\nIt's another day of sun\n\nJust another day of sun\n\nIt's another day of sun\n\nAnother day has just begun\n\nIt's another day of sun\n\n\n\nIt's another day of sun!"

The ground has broken
So I must go
Now I must go
And where the journey may lead me
Let your prayers be my guide
I cannot stay here, my family
But I'll remember my pride
Prideland I have no choice
My land I will find my way

بعضی وقت ها به زمانی که باهم بودیم فکر میکنم
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
مثل وقتی که میگفتی ممکنه از فرط خوشحالی بمیری
Told myself that you were right for me
به خودم میگفتم که تو برای من بهترینی (مناسب ترین انتخاب برای من هستی)
But felt so lonely in your company
اما کنارت احساس  تنهایی میکردم
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
اما اون عشق بود و این یک درد که هنوز به یاد میارم
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
تو میتونی به یک نوع خاصی از ناراحتی اعتیاد پیدا کنی
Like resignation to the end, always the end
مثل وقتی که آدم تسلیم میشه تو زندگی وقتی میدونی تهش پایانه و مرگه
So when we found that we could not make sense
پس وقتی که فهمیدیم ما به درد هم نمیخوریم
Well, you said that we would still be friends
خب، تو گفتی که ما میتونیم همچنان دوست بمونیم
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over
اما من اعتراف میکنم از اینکه همه چی بینمون تموم شد، خوشحال بودم
But you didn't have to cut me off
ولی تو مجبور نبودی منو از زندگیت حذف کنی
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
انگاری که هیچ وقت اتفاقی نیوفتاده و ما هیچی نبودیم
And I don't even need your love
و من حتی احتیاجی به عشق تو ندارم
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
اما تو با من مثل یک غریبه رفتار میکنی که این حس خیلی بدیه"

High dive into frozen waves
Where the past comes back to life
Fight fear for the selfish pain
It was worth it every time
Hold still right before we crash
'Cause we both know how this ends
Our clock ticks till it breaks your glass
And I drown in you again
[Pre-Chorus: Foxes]
'Cause you are the piece of me
I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly
Still fight and I don't know why
[Chorus: Foxes]
If our love is tragedy
Why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity
Why are you my clarity
[Verse 2: Foxes]
Walk on through a red parade
And refuse to make amends
It cuts deep through our ground
And makes us forget all common sense
Don't speak as I try to leave
'Cause we both know what we'll choose
If you pull, then I'll push too deep
And I'll fall right back to you"

When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I usually love sleeping all alone
This time around, bring your friend with you
But we ain't really gonna sleep at all
You ain't gon' catch me with them sneak pictures, sneak pictures
In my city, I'm a young God
That pussy kill be so vicious
My God white, he in my pocket
He get me redder than the devil 'til I go nauseous (Oh)
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
She asked me if I do this every day, I said, ""Often""
Asked how many times she rode the wave, ""Not so often"" (Baby)
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby, I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl, I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often, often, girl, I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often"

At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
I understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it... oh, so won't

 With summer now  upon us I decided to compile a playlist (if you will) of a majority of songs that I feel set a hype or positive vibe and that can be expressed almost anywhere. Obviously songs labeled explicit may have some swearing (some may have a lot) but overall get things bumpin'
Music here spans a variety of genres that come from many artists I personally admire. Hope you give some of these a listen to and have a great time wherever you may play them!

[Verse 1: Papa Emeritus III]
I feel your presence amongst us
You cannot hide in the darkness
Can you hear the rumble?
Can you hear the rumble that's calling?
I know your soul is not tainted
Even though you've been told so
Can you hear the rumble?
Can you hear the rumble that's calling?
[Chorus: Papa Emeritus III]
I can feel the thunder that's breakin' in your heart
I can see through the scars inside you
I can feel the thunder that's breakin' in your heart
I can see through the scars inside you
[Verse 2: Papa Emeritus III]
A candle casting a faint glow
You and I see eye to eye
Can you hear the thunder?
How can you hear the thunder that's breaking?
Now there is nothing between us
From now our merge is eternal
Can't you see that you're lost?
Can't you see that you're lost without me?"

Toss A Coin To Your Witcher,"Sonya Belousova, Giona Ostinelli, Joey Batey",0JnNzCUsHuDcUcBatOzuGP,2KMLGJ1mPfRE4GNdL92rl3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,"[Verse 1]
When a humble bard graced a ride along
With Geralt of Rivia, along came this song
From when the White Wolf fought a silver-tongued devil
His army of elves at his hooves did they revel
They came after me with masterful deceit
Broke down my lute and they kicked in my teeth
While the Devil's horns minced our tender meat
And so cried the Witcher, ""He can't be bleat""
[Chorus]
Toss a coin to your Witcher
O Valley of Plenty, O Valley of Plenty, oh
Toss a coin to your Witcher
O Valley of Plenty
[Verse 2]
At the edge of the world, fight the mighty horn
That bashes and breaks you and brings you to mourn
He thrust every elf far back on the shelf
High up on the mountain from whence it came
He wiped out your pest, got kicked in his chest
He's a friend of humanity, so give him the rest
That's my epic tale: our champion prevailed
Defeated the villain, 
now pour him some ale"
